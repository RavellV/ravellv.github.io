                <img src="http://via.placeholder.com/895x552.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Blog image"/>
                <div class="blog-excerpt open-sans-font pb-5">
                    <p>No matter how well organized you are, you probably experienced a moment in your life, when you had to work on a project that was due the next week, but you didn’t end up working on it until the very last moment. Hey, no judgement here, 
                        I’ve definitely been there. Procrastination is a real problem and it isn’t very new either. The Greek philosopher Aristotle actually described a very similar phenomenon: Akrasia, the state of mind in which someone acts against their better 
                        judgement through weakness of will. </p>
                    <h2>What is Procrastination?</h2>
                    <p>Procrastination comes from (Lat.) pro-crastinus, which translates to: belonging to tomorrow. The Oxford Dictionary defines Procrastination as the action of delaying or postponing something. Procrastination often creates a vicious cycle. 
                        The act of procrastinating leads to feeling guilty, which leads to doubting, which leads to helplessness, which then leads to procrastination and so on.</p>
                    <p>Some examples of procrastination are: Browsing social media to avoid getting started on that essay that’s due in a week. “Just one more episode”; There it is again, another example for procrastination. But the one I myself am very guilty 
                        of is binging TV-shows. Procrastination comes in various shapes and sizes, from TikTok to Gmail.  </p>
                    <p>Actually, around 20% of US adults consider themselves to be chronic procrastinators (according to Joseph Ferrari, professor at DePaul University in Chicago). Whilst a lot of people struggle with procrastination, it’s especially students 
                        who are immensely affected by procrastination. Approximately 80%-95% of college students engage in procrastination to some degree, 70% consider themselves to be procrastinators and about 50% say that they procrastinate consistently. 
                        A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/089443930101900403">2001 study</a> found that the average amount of internet procrastination of the subjects were 1.59 hours per day.</p>
                    <p>It’s very important to know that procrastination has nothing to do with being lazy. Being lazy means, that you’re not doing your tasks and you're okay with that. Procrastinators have the desire to actually achieve something, but they can’t force themselves to start. </p>
                    <p>According to a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65">survey</a>, 94% of the participants indicated that procrastinating has had a negative impact on their happiness, and around 18% said, that this effect was extremely negative. Some people consider procrastination to be an innocuous habit at worst. 
                        It doesn’t matter when a task gets done, as long as it’s finished eventually. Some might even say, that they work best under pressure. Joseph Ferrari explains, that yes, some can work well under pressure, but you cannot work better under pressure. 
                        In fact, working a lot under pressure can cause mental and physical illness and stress. A study back in 1997 looked at the scores and wellbeing of students who were procrastinating and compared it to students who weren’t. Initially, procrastination 
                        seemed to lower the stress levels of students. In the end, however, the students who procrastinated earned lower grades and showed higher cumulative amounts of stress and illness. Another common issue with procrastination is sleep insufficiency, 
                        especially when people engage in bedtime procrastination (procrastinating from going to bed). </p>
                    <h2>Why do we procrastinate? </h2>
                    <p>The trigger of procrastination is always some sort of stress. What most people don’t know is that procrastination is a habit, which means that like all habits, it can be broken down into these four aspects: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The Cue:</b> in the case of procrastination: stress</li>
                        <li><b>The Craving:</b> the craving for a relief of stress</li>
                        <li><b>The Response:</b> this is where every situation can be different. The response could be almost anything, let’s say for example scrolling through social media</li>
                        <li><b>The Reward:</b> The reward is the release of dopamine, which makes you feel more happy and less stressed (at the moment)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There can be countless things that could trigger stress. The most common are having undefined tasks, a lack of energy, being overwhelmed by the task at hand, fear of failure. </p>
                    <h3>Types of Procrastinators </h3>
                    <p>The two main types of procrastinators are passive and active procrastinators. Passive delay tasks because they have trouble making decisions and acting upon them. Active procrastinators,
                        however delay tasks purposefully, because they think that they work better under pressure, which is, as already mentioned, proven to be a myth.  </p>
                    <p>Procrastinators can also be defined by different behavioral styles.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The Perfectionist</b> procrastinates because of their fear of not being able to complete a task perfectly.</li>
                        <li><b>The Worrier</b> puts off tasks because of their fear of leaving their comfort zone.</li>
                        <li><b>The Dreamer</b> procrastinates due to their lack of detail-oriented work. </li>
                        <li><b>The Crisis Maker</b> likes working under pressure and therefor puts tasks off.</li>
                        <li><b>The Overdoer</b> takes on too many tasks and doesn’t find the time to finish everything.</li>
                        <li><b>The Defier</b> is someone who puts off tasks because they don’t believe that someone should dictate their time schedule</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>How people deal with their Procrastination? </h3>
                    <p>There are nearly endless coping mechanisms that people use to deal with their procrastination. The most important one being Denial. 
                        Some people tell themselves, that they're not really procrastinating, by engaging in unimportant and often unnecessary activities to make them feel like 
                        they’re achieving something. Others deal with their procrastination with Humor, this could go from making fun of high achieving ’nerds’ to making jokes about themselves. 
                        One thing I found myself practicing a lot is Self-blame. I blamed myself a lot for procrastinating, because I wanted to achieve something, but I didn’t, 
                        due to procrastination. Self-blame never helps, it only makes you depressed and it diminishes your self-esteem. </p>
                    <h2>How to stop procrastinating? </h2>
                    <h3>Recognize Procrastination </h3>
                    <p>Before you can stop procrastinating, you have to recognize that you’re procrastinating. Seems easy enough, here are some signs that you might be procrastinating: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You fill your day with low priority tasks </li>
                        <li>You push back important tasks </li>
                        <li>You read emails without making a decision about them </li>
                        <li>You stop for coffee immediately after you started working on something </li>
                        <li>You spend too much time dreaming and overthinking </li>
                        <li>You don’t finish what you start </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Why are you procrastinating? </h3>
                    <p>To find out what needs to be changed, you have to identify why you are procrastinating. If you don’t know the problem, there is no solution. So, ask yourself questions like these. </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Is the task at hand unpleasant?</li>
                        <li>Are you overwhelmed by the size of the project?</li>
                        <li>Are you having trouble getting started?</li>
                        <li>Are you constantly interrupted?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Analyze why you are procrastinating and now that you know that, here are some anti-procrastination techniques. </p>
                    
                    <h3>#1 Eat a frog every morning </h3>
                    <p>I know it’s a rather disturbing title, but hear me out. The idea of this strategy is to do the task that haunts you most as the first thing when you start working, because most of the time 
                        it is this task that we want to procrastinate from doing. And if you keep pushing it to the deadlines, more and more ’frogs’ will be on your plate, only making it harder to get things done. </p>
                    <p><b>This strategy helps you if:</b> You are filling your day with low priority tasks and are constantly avoiding doing the most important ones. </p>
                    
                    <h3>#2 Minimize Distractions </h3>
                    <p>A very common cause for procrastination is the instagram, twitter or tiktok message that pops up while you're working.” Oh, who liked my post?” turns into 2 hours of endless scrolling through social 
                        media and you still have not written more than one sentence on that essay. There are two types of distractions. One comes from your electronic devices, and the other distractions come from your environment. </p>
                    <p>To keep distractions away, I recommend cleaning your room and especially your desk. Have very little things at your desk so that nothing other than the task that you’re currently working on can catch your attention. 
                        Studies show that having a tidy environment helps the brain to focus just on the work at hand and not that letter, that has been laying on your desk for over 2 weeks. Put your phone on ‘do not disturb mode’ and turn it face down, or just simply put it in another room. </p>
                    <p><b>This strategy helps you if:</b> You are finding yourself getting started with a task but being distracted by your phone/ environment. </p>
                    
                    <h3>#3 Break down tasks into manageable chunks </h3>
                    <p>Oftentimes we have trouble with procrastination or even just starting a project, because the project is so big or because of just not knowing where to start. </p>
                    <p>Breaking down these big projects into different actions will make it way easier to keep track of progress. An example for this could be:</p>
                    <p>You have to write an essay. The Actions to break down into could look like following: Write rough outline of essay, do research on the topics, write an introduction, write about the first, second, third... topic, finish essay, let someone else proofread your essay, hand in essay. </p>
                    <p><b>This strategy helps you if:</b> You are overwhelmed by a project and don’t know where to start. </p>
                    
                    <h3>#4 Accountability Partners </h3>
                    <p>The Idea of this technique is to tell someone else that you want to finish whatever task it is you want to finish and ask him to check if you did it. This creates peer pressure; you don’t want to look bad in front of your friend, and it makes it far more likely that you’ll avoid procrastination. 
                        You can even go a step further and put money on the line.</p>
                    <p><b>This strategy helps you if:</b> You are having trouble keeping true to your goals</p>
                    
                    <h3>#5 Make virtual deadlines </h3>
                    <p>This one is pretty straight forward. Making virtual deadlines for your task will make it way easier to keep track of progress, and it will prevent you from pushing back to the last moment. To reinforce these deadlines, you can work with an accountability partner.</p>
                    <p><b>This strategy helps you if:</b> You are pushing back tasks until the very last second.</p>
                    
                    <h3>#6 Prioritize your Tasks</h3>
                    <p>You can use different prioritization techniques, the easiest however is Eisenhower’s Urgent/Important principle. Write down all the tasks you have to complete, like this:</p>
                    <table>
                      <tr>
                        <th></th>
                        <th>Urgent</th>
                        <th>Not Urgent</th>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Important</td>
                        <td>Task #1</td>
                        <td>Task #2</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Not important</td>
                        <td>Task #3</td>
                        <td>Task #4</td>
                      </tr>
                    </table> 
                    <p>The Highest priority tasks are important and urgent, then important but not urgent, not important but urgent and the last neither important nor urgent. </p>
                    <p><b>This strategy helps you if:</b> You are not sure what you want to do first.</p>
                    
                    <h3>#7 Count to five </h3>
                    <p>The idea of this strategy is when you feel like you’re about to procrastinate, slowly count to five and do it for five minutes. This doesn’t mean that you just stop after the five minutes, 
                        but because you already started it will be very easy to keep going for another 20, 30 or 60 minutes. Like Newtons first Law says: if a body is at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line, 
                        it will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless it is acted upon by a force. The counting activates your prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that takes part 
                        in cognitive control functions (it’s the part of the brain that makes the decisions). This is by far my favorite since it has been the most effective one out of all for me personally.</p>
                    <p><b>This strategy helps you if:</b> You are having trouble getting started with your tasks</p>
                    
                    <p>These anti-procrastination techniques can be used in different scenarios. Some of these are better for specific problems, like: <b>prioritizing your tasks</b>, and some can be used all the time, like: <b>Count to five</b>. 
                        Choose the techniques based on what you’re dealing with. And if you want to take it to the next level, use other time management and organizational techniques, since it has been proven to improve people’s tendency to procrastinate.</p>
