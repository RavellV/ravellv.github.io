                <img src="http://via.placeholder.com/895x552.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Blog image"/>
                <div class="blog-excerpt open-sans-font pb-5">
                    <p>No matter how well organized you are, you probably experienced a moment in your life, when you had to work on a project that was due the next week, but you didn’t end up working on it until the very last moment. Hey, no judgement here, 
                        I’ve definitely been there. Procrastination is a real problem and it isn’t very new either. The Greek philosopher Aristotle actually described a very similar phenomenon: Akrasia, the state of mind in which someone acts against their better 
                        judgement through weakness of will. </p>
                    <h2>What is Procrastination?</h2>
                    <p>Procrastination comes from (Lat.) pro-crastinus, which translates to: belonging to tomorrow. The Oxford Dictionary defines Procrastination as the action of delaying or postponing something. Procrastination often creates a vicious cycle. 
                        The act of procrastinating leads to feeling guilty, which leads to doubting, which leads to helplessness, which then leads to procrastination and so on.</p>
                    <p>Some examples of procrastination are: Browsing social media to avoid getting started on that essay that’s due in a week. “Just one more episode”; There it is again, another example for procrastination. But the one I myself am very guilty 
                        of is binging TV-shows. Procrastination comes in various shapes and sizes, from TikTok to Gmail.  </p>
                    <p>Actually, around 20% of US adults consider themselves to be chronic procrastinators (according to Joseph Ferrari, professor at DePaul University in Chicago). Whilst a lot of people struggle with procrastination, it’s especially students 
                        who are immensely affected by procrastination. Approximately 80%-95% of college students engage in procrastination to some degree, 70% consider themselves to be procrastinators and about 50% say that they procrastinate consistently. 
                        A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/089443930101900403">2001 study</a> found that the average amount of internet procrastination of the subjects were 1.59 hours per day.</p>
                    <p>It’s very important to know that procrastination has nothing to do with being lazy. Being lazy means, that you’re not doing your tasks and you're okay with that. Procrastinators have the desire to actually achieve something, but they can’t force themselves to start. </p>
                    <p>According to a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65">survey</a>, 94% of the participants indicated that procrastinating has had a negative impact on their happiness, and around 18% said, that this effect was extremely negative. Some people consider procrastination to be an innocuous habit at worst. 
                        It doesn’t matter when a task gets done, as long as it’s finished eventually. Some might even say, that they work best under pressure. Joseph Ferrari explains, that yes, some can work well under pressure, but you cannot work better under pressure. 
                        In fact, working a lot under pressure can cause mental and physical illness and stress. A study back in 1997 looked at the scores and wellbeing of students who were procrastinating and compared it to students who weren’t. Initially, procrastination 
                        seemed to lower the stress levels of students. In the end, however, the students who procrastinated earned lower grades and showed higher cumulative amounts of stress and illness. Another common issue with procrastination is sleep insufficiency, 
                        especially when people engage in bedtime procrastination (procrastinating from going to bed). </p>
                    <h2>Why do we procrastinate? </h2>
                    <p>The trigger of procrastination is always some sort of stress. What most people don’t know is that procrastination is a habit, which means that like all habits, it can be broken down into these four aspects: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The Cue:</b> in the case of procrastination: stress</li>
                        <li><b>The Craving:</b> the craving for a relief of stress</li>
                        <li><b>The Response:</b> this is where every situation can be different. The response could be almost anything, let’s say for example scrolling through social media</li>
                        <li><b>The Reward:</b> The reward is the release of dopamine, which makes you feel more happy and less stressed (at the moment)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There can be countless things that could trigger stress. The most common are having undefined tasks, a lack of energy, being overwhelmed by the task at hand, fear of failure. </p>
                    <h3>Types of Procrastinators </h3>
                    <p>The two main types of procrastinators are passive and active procrastinators. Passive delay tasks because they have trouble making decisions and acting upon them. Active procrastinators,
                        however delay tasks purposefully, because they think that they work better under pressure, which is, as already mentioned, proven to be a myth.  </p>
                    <p>Procrastinators can also be defined by different behavioral styles.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The Perfectionist</b> procrastinates because of their fear of not being able to complete a task perfectly.</li>
                        <li><b>The Worrier</b> puts off tasks because of their fear of leaving their comfort zone.</li>
                        <li><b>The Dreamer</b> procrastinates due to their lack of detail-oriented work. </li>
                        <li><b>The Crisis Maker</b> likes working under pressure and therefor puts tasks off.</li>
                        <li><b>The Overdoer</b> takes on too many tasks and doesn’t find the time to finish everything.</li>
                        <li><b>The Defier</b> is someone who puts off tasks because they don’t believe that someone should dictate their time schedule</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
